All species of plants, wild and cultivated alike, are subject to disease. Although each species is susceptible to characteristic diseases, these are, in each case, relatively few in number. The occurrence and prevalence of plant diseases vary from season to season, depending on the presence of the pathogen, environmental conditions, and the crops and varieties grown. Plant diseases are known from times preceding the earliest writings. Fossil evidence indicates that plants were affected by disease 250 million years ago.</h3>

                <h4 style="display: inline-flex; margin: 0;padding: 0%;">Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects many of our landscape plants, flowers, vegetables and fruits. Powdery mildew is an easy one to identify.</h4>
                <h5>Infected plants will display a white powdery substance that is most visible on upper leaf surfaces, but it can appear anywhere on the plant including stems, flower buds, and even the fruit of the plant. <h5>
                  <h3>What causes Powdery Mildew ?</h3>
                  <p>Powdery mildew, mainly caused by the fungus Podosphaera xanthii, infects all cucurbits, including muskmelons, squash, cucumbers, gourds, watermelons and pumpkins.
                    Powdery mildew infections favor humid conditions with temperatures around 68-81° F.
                    In warm, dry conditions, new spores form and easily spread the disease.
                    Symptoms of powdery mildew first appear mid to late summer in Minnesota. The older leaves are more susceptible and powdery mildew will infect them first.
                    Wind blows spores produced in leaf spots to infect other leaves.
                    Under favorable conditions, powdery mildew can spread very rapidly, often covering all of the leaves. </p>
                    <h3>What kills powdery mildew naturally ?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mix 1 tablespoon baking soda with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon dish soap in 1 gallon of water.</li>
                         <li>Mix 4 tablespoons baking soda with 2 tablespoons of Murphy’s oil soap in 1 gallon of water.</li>
                         <li>Mix 2 to 3 tablespoons vinegar with 1 gallon of water. Be sure to test this first because vinegar can burn plants.</li>
                         <li>Neem is an organic fungicide. Follow instructions on the label.</li>
                         <li>Mix 1 part milk with 10 parts water.</li>
                         <li>Some folks swear by mouthwash as an effective fungicide but it is not organic. They recommend 1 cup mouthwash to 3 cups of water.</li>
                    </ul>
                       <h3>How to identify?</h3>
                       <p>Powdery mildew is one of the easiest plant diseases to recognize. The first sign of problems is usually white, powdery spots or patches on the top side of leaves or on plant stems. The powdery surface growth gradually spreads to cover the entire leaf, including the undersides, until the plant looks like it's dusted with white powder.

                        Infected leaves turn yellow and twisted. New shoots and buds develop distorted growth. Flowers and fruit are normally spared the white mildew, but infected plants have low yields and poor-quality fruits.</p>
                       <h3>What are the tips for controlling Powdery Mildew ?</h3>
                       <ul>
                        <li>Inspect plants that you buy from a greenhouse before purchasing for mildew (and insects). </li>
                        <li>Wiping off the leaves is not an effective powdery mildew treatment as it will return within days of cleaning.</li>
                        <li>Because spores overwinter in debris all infected debris should be removed. Trim and remove infected plant parts. </li>
                        <li>Do not till the debris into the soil or use in the compost pile. </li>
                        <li>Space plants far enough apart to increase air circulation and reduce humidity.</li>

                <h4 style="display: inline-flex; margin: 0;padding: 0%;">  Downy mildews, are more related to algae and produce grayish fuzzy looking spores on the lower surfaces of leaves.</h4>
                <h5>Downy mildew is an umbrella term for a large number of plant diseases. It is not a true fungus. They attack vegetables, fruits, and flowers. By the time a plant shows symptoms, it is too late. Prevention is key.<h5>
                  <h3>What causes Downy Mildew ?</h3>
                  <p>Downy mildew is caused by a fungus-like water mold which infects cucumbers, pumpkins, winter squash, and melons. It primarily infects the leaves, resulting in decreased photosynthesis leading to reduced yield and poor fruit quality; infections can be severe enough to kill the plant. The pathogen does not overwinter in the northeast, but is reintroduced each season, usually this occurs late enough to limit its effect. </p>
                    <h3>What kills downy mildew  ?</h3>
                    <p>Baking soda is an excellent solution to treat downy mildew.</p>
                    <ul>
                         <li>Dissolve 1 table spoon baking soda in 1 quart (1 liter) water (ideally rainwater or mineral water, for the water to be softer).</li>
                         <li>In dry weather, spray this mix on all the leaves, spraying both on top and on the underside of leaves.</li>
                    </ul>
                       <h3>What are the Symptoms and Signs of Downy mildew ?</h3>
                       <p>On the foliage, downy mildew symptoms begin as
                        small, water-soaked spots. Lesions first appear
                        slightly chlorotic, with a yellow-green appearance
                        and progress to a bright yellow on the upper leaf
                        surface. As lesions progress, they become angular,
                        brown (necrotic) and distorted, and plants may
                        defoliate.</p>

                       <h3>What are the Tips for Downy Mildew Treatment ?</h3>
                       <ul>
                        <li>Downy mildew needs water to survive and spread.  It there is no water on your leaves, the disease cannot spread. Keep water off leaves as much as possible.  </li> 
                        <li>Because the disease overwinters on dead plant debris, be sure to clean around your plants in the fall to help prevent the disease in the following spring.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <h3>What are the Conditions in which downy mildew appears and spreads ?</h3>
                         <p>Moisture is the main factor that triggers its spread.
                            Like most fungal attacks, downy mildew will spread fastest after rain showers.
                            Mildew is hindered when plants are spread far apart and air circulates well.</p>

                <h4 style="display: inline-flex; margin: 0;padding: 0%;">Black spot is one of the most common diseases found on roses, but it can also occur on other ornamental and garden plants.  This fungal disease causes black, round spots that form on the upper sides of leaves. </h4>
                <h5>Lower leaves are usually infected first.  Severe infestations cause infected leaves to turn yellow and fall off the plant. Black spot is a problem during extended periods of wet weather or when leaves are wet for 6 hours or more.  <h5>
                  <h3>what is Black Spot Tip ?</h3>
                  <p> Black spot overwinters on infected foliage and rose canes. Always prune away infected stems and dispose of the debris - never compost them. Disinfect your pruners with a household disinfectant after every use. Well-intended trims with dirty pruners spread the infection.
                    Always read product labels thoroughly and follow instructions, including application rates and frequencies.</p>
                    <h3>What are the Black Spot Identification/Symptoms ?</h3>
                    <p>The first hint of black spot's arrival in your rose garden comes in the form of dark, round leaf spots with irregular, feathered margins. Unlike many fungal diseases, black spot only strikes the top side of leaves, never the undersides. The lowest parts of the plant show symptoms first. Left unchecked, yellow areas surround the spots and expand to cover entire leaf. The disease worsens and moves up the plant, while infected foliage drops to the ground.</p>
                    <h3>How to Control Black Spot ?</h3>
                    <p>Once black spot becomes active, the only way to control the disease and stop its spread is with an effective fungicide. GardenTech® brand's Daconil® fungicides offer highly effective, three-way protection against black spot and more than 65 other types of fungal disease.
                        Start preventive treatment as soon as buds on rose canes begin to swell and break in spring. Repeat treatment every seven to 14 days until conditions no longer favor the disease.</p>
                    <h3>What are the Tips for Controlling Black Spots on Leaves ?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plant in well-draining soil. Keep your plants healthy by providing regular feedings of organic fertilizer. This will help prevent fungal disease in plants.</li>
                         <li>The fungus spores overwinter in plant debris. Remove dead leaves and infected canes from around the plants and disguard in the trash. Do not add to the compost pile.</li>
                         <li>Disinfect your pruners with a household disinfectant after every use.  Ethanol or isopropyl alcohol can be used straight out of the bottle.  </li>

Once a plant contracts the mosaic virus, the infected plant can then spread the virus to other plants and even affect an entire harvest if left untreated.</h4>
                <h5> Mosaic viruses affect a wide variety of horticultural and vegetable crops — roses, beans, tobacco, tomatoes, potatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins, squash, melons, and peppers.<h5>
                  <h3>How do plants get the mosaic virus ?</h3>
                  <p> Mosaic viruses can be spread by weeds, infected seeds, an infected plant, or certain insects.
 Mosaic virus overwinters on perennial weeds and is spread by insects that feed on them. Aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies, and cucumber beetles are common garden pests that can transmit this disease. </p>
                    <h3>Is the mosaic virus bad ?</h3>
                    <p>Although infected fruits are safe to eat, the rapid disease development in an infected plant can cause severe damage to a harvest. The virus will not create fruit to rot prematurely, but it will affect the anatomy of the plants such as the number of leaves. This, in turn, decreases fruit production and can dramatically reduce the yield of a harvest.</p>
                    <h3>How do I know if my plant has mosaic virus ?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <p>The typical symptoms of the mosaic virus include:</p>
                        <li>Yellow, white or green stripes/ streaks/ spots on foliage</li>
                        <li>Wrinkled, curled, or small leaves</li>
                        <li>Pronounced yellowing only of veins</li>
                        <li>Infected fruit appears mottled and develops raised “warty” areas</li>
                        <li>stems that dry out rapidly</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>How do I get rid of a mosaic virus ?</h3>
                    <p>There are no cures for viral diseases, such as the mosaic virus, once a plant is infected. As a result, every effort should be made to prevent the disease from entering your garden.</p>

            <h5>Fusarium wilt can survive for years in the soil and is spread by water, insects and garden equipment. The fungal disease develops during hot weather and is most destructive when soil temperatures approach 80˚F. <h5>
              <h3>How to Control Fusarium Wilt ?</h3>
              <p>Once fusarium wilt infects a plant, there is no effective treatment. Remove and dispose of affected plants immediately; don't compost this garden refuse. Whenever possible, remove and replace fusarium-infected garden soil. If fusarium wilt hits your garden, don't plant the same or related plant types in that area for at least four years.

                Depending on your climate, it may be possible to control fusarium wilt by "solarizing" your soil. This involves covering it with plastic so it reaches very high temperatures over a long period. </p>
                <h3>What are the Symptoms of Fusarium wilt ?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stunted growth</li>
                    <li>Yellowing and wilting of the leaves</li>
                    <li>White, pink or orange fungal growth on the outside of affected stems, particularly in wet conditions</li>
                    <li>Root or stem decay – affected China asters often have blackened, rotting stem bases</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What kills Fusarium fungus?</h3>
                <p>There is no effective fungicide or other cure for Fusarium wilt. The pathogen nearly always kills infected hosts. Prevention and exclusion are the only effective management strategies. Avoid this problem by replanting at that site using species from different genera than plants previously infected there by Fusarium.</p>
                <h3>What are the treatment measures for fusarium virus ?</h3>
                <ul>
                 <li>Plant resistant varieties when available.</li>
                 <li>Remove stricken growth from the garden and sterilize pruning clippers (one part bleach to 4 parts water) between cuts.</li>
                <li>Use Safer® Yard & Garden Insect Killer to control many garden insects, like cucumber beetles, which are known to spread the disease.</li>
                <li>High nitrogen fertilizers may increase susceptibility to the disease. Test your soil and use a slow-release, organic fertilizer in the vegetable garden.</li>

          <h3>How to Control Verticillium Wilt ?</h3>
          <p> There is no effective treatment for verticillium wilt. For affected vegetables, remove and dispose of the plant; don't compost it. For landscape plants, prune out affected branches and dispose of them immediately. Do not use infected wood for chips for landscape mulch. Careful attention to watering and other plant needs may help extend a plant's life as well. Depending on where you live, you may be able to control verticillium wilt through professional soil fumigation or other means. In warm climates, plastic-covered soil may reach temperatures high enough to suppress the fungi at fault. </p>
            <h3>What are the Symptoms of Verticillium wilt ?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Yellowing and shrivelling of lower leaves</li>
                <li>Some or all of the plant suddenly wilts, especially in hot weather. Plants may recover in cooler or wetter conditions</li>
                 <li>Branch dieback is a common symptom in trees and shrubs. Sometimes only part of the plant may wilt and dead branches may indicate infections which occurred in previous years</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to identify?</h3>
            <p>Plant leaves generally reveal the first hint of verticillium wilt infections. In infected tomatoes, yellowing starts with edges of the oldest, lowest leaves. Sometimes, though not always, symptoms show only on one side of the plant. With severe leaf damage and drop, fruit suffers sun damage.
            In maples and similar landscape plants, a single large branch or stem may yellow and droop, then brown and die.  In some cases, the outside of the stem, branch, or trunk becomes discolored, too. </p>
            <h3>What is the Verticillium Wilt Tip ?</h3>
            <p>If verticillium wilt finds its way into your garden, it can linger in soil for many years. Avoid planting the same crop or related crops in affected areas for at least four years. If not, you may help prolong its stay.
            Always read product labels thoroughly and follow instructions, including guidelines for treatable diseases and plants.</p>

        <h4 style="display: inline-flex; margin: 0;padding: 0%;">Sooty mold is a fungal disease that grows on plants and other surfaces covered by honeydew, a sticky substance created by certain insects. Sooty mold’s name comes from the dark threadlike growth (mycelium) of the fungi resembling a layer of soot.</h4>
        <h5> Sooty mold doesn’t infect plants but grows on plant parts and other surfaces where honeydew deposits accumulate.<h5>
          <h3>How it cause damage to plants ?</h3>
          <p>It is important to note that sooty mold is not an infection, it is a superficial growth on the surface of the plant tissue. The fungi do not feed on the host plant. This condition is mainly cosmetic, but it can still cause damage and injury to plants. In severe cases, the fungal growth can be so dark and so extensive that it can block sunlight from being absorbed by the leaves. If this happens, the leaves will be unable to produce adequate amounts of chlorophyll, and this can limit their ability to photosynthesize. Fruits and vegetables may also be affected, but these are usually still edible as long as you wash off the mold with warm water and mild soap before use. </p>
            <h3>What are the Conditions that Favor Sooty Mold ?</h3>
            <p>This condition is found in gardens throughout temperate and tropical regions, and is often seen in the summer months when insect populations have had a chance to become established. Fungal spores germinate in damp conditions in the presence of honeydew and rapidly colonize the surface they are on, forming dark mycelial mats.
                Warm, dry weather can also increase the prevalence of sooty molds.
                Plants that are stressed by lack of moisture are more likely to suffer from aphid infestations, which results in the production of more honeydew.
                Another factor is that during dry periods, the lack of rain prevents the honeydew from being diluted or washed off the plant, which can increase the incidence and severity of this condition.</p>
            <h3>What are the Hosts, Symptoms & Signs ?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>any plant where aphids, soft scales, leafhoppers, whiteflies or mealybugs feed and honeydew is produced</li>
                <li>black fungal growth on leaves, fruit, branches and stems</li>
                <li>stunted growth or early leaf drop in severe cases</li>
                <li>causes indirect damage by reducing photosynthesizing leaf surface area</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to control Sooty mold ?</h3>
           <p>In home gardens, sooty mold is an unsightly cosmetic condition that usually won’t cause permanent damage to your plants – especially those that are well established.

            If you control the insects that produce honeydew, you cut off the food source for the fungi and the sooty mold will typically disappear on its own. Treatment with fungicides is not recommended. Fungicide applications may kill the fungi and reduce the spread, but will not remove the black coating from the plant or prevent a future outbreak.</p>

        <h4 style="display: inline-flex; margin: 0;padding: 0%;">Snow mold is caused by cold-weather fungi that primarily affect cool-season grasses. Signs of a problem aren’t noticeable until the spring when the snow melts.</h4>
        <h5>Most signs of spring are the welcome kind, including buds, blooms, warmer temps, and green grass. But gray-colored circles on your lawn? Not so much.<h5>
          <h3>What Causes Snow Mold ?</h3>
          <p> A heavy blanket of melting snow may look really pretty, until it you see the damage it can do to your lawn. Snow mold is most problematic when you receive a heavy, deep snowfall before the ground has completely frozen. All that weight on fragile grass plants, coupled with lots of wintertime moisture, not to mention cover from leaves, long grass, and lawn debris, spells trouble in the form of snow mold. </p>
            <h3>What are the Signs of Snow Mold ?</h3>
            <p>Signs of both pink and gray snow mold are usually most noticeable in the spring when the snow begins to melt. As the snow melts, straw-colored circular patches ranging in size from a few inches to several feet across appear in the lawn. The grass in these patches is usually matted down and crusty. The patches will have a grayish-white appearance if they are caused by gray snow mold, or a whitish-pink appearance when caused by pink snow mold. Pink snow mold can be more severe than gray snow mold, as it can kill the crown and roots of grass plants; gray snow mold usually only affects the grass blades.</p>
            <h3>How to Treat Snow Mold ?</h3>
            <p>The key to beating snow mold is prevention, as there are no fungicide treatments that work on snow mold in the spring when the snow melts. If you have repeated issues with snow mold in the spring, you can apply a preventative application of Scotts® DiseaseEx™ Lawn Fungicide in fall (usually around Thanksgiving) before the first heavy snowfall.
             If you don't apply a preventative fungicide in fall and you find snow mold damage in your lawn in early spring, the first thing you’ll need to do is gently rake the affected areas to loosen any matted grass. This will help the lawn dry and give unaffected grass room to grow.</p>
            <h3>How to Prevent Snow Mold ?</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Mow Before the First Snow: Extra-long grass is a breeding ground for gray snow mold. Make your last cut of the growing season 1 to 11⁄2 inches shorter than usual (but be careful not to scalp the lawn).</li>
            <li>Don't Let Leaves Pile Up: Because a thick layer of leaves creates a welcome environment for snow mold, use your mower to mulch leaves into your lawn.</li>
            <li>Dethatch: A thick thatch layer produces an ideal home for snow mold to develop. If your lawn’s thatch layer is greater than 3⁄4 inch thick, dethatch in the fall to help prevent snow mold from developing during the winter.</li>
             <li>Go Easy on Nitrogen: A fertilizer containing readily-available nitrogen is great for fast greening, but too much, especially late in the season, can invite snow mold. Instead, apply a slow-release lawn food like Scotts® Turf Builder® WinterGuard® Fall Lawn Food.</li>

        <h4 style="display: inline-flex; margin: 0;padding: 0%;">There are around 8,000 named species of rust diseases, many of them host-specific. Scientists speculate there are many more types of rust diseases in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world that have not been discovered yet. </h4>
        <h5>  Rust diseases are an important class of plant pathogens that affects many economically important crops, including cereal crops, flowering plants, and ornamental plants.<h5>
          <h3>What is Rust Disease ?</h3>
          <p> Rust disease is an obligate fungal parasite that grows on a wide variety of plants useful to humans. All rust fungi are in the order Pucciniales (formerly Uredinales) although there are many types of individual rust diseases. Most of these types can only grow on one or two species of plant.</p>
            <h3>What are the Symptoms of Rust Fungi ?</h3>
            <p>The signature symptom of rust is the orange, yellow, brown, or red spore masses on the outside of the plant. This color gives the rust fungus its name. These spores appear as raised dots on the leaves or stems of the plant. Some types of rust form galls that then become covered in the spore masses. Rust occasionally forms on blooms.
                Symptoms occur from the ground up. They are usually on the underside of the leaves but may also appear on the top of them. It may cause witches broom growth (redish, twisted stems and leaves), cankers, oozes, and spotted needles. Rust may cause leaves to fall prematurely. If enough of the leaves fall, the plant may die. Plants may be stunted, off color, and weak. Plants that are heavily affected for 2-3 years in a row may die if not treated. </p>
            <h3>How to Prevent Rust Fungus ?</h3>
            <p>It is very difficult to prevent rust fungus in your garden because it appears in such a wide variety of plants. However, there are some cultural things you can do to lower the chance your plant gets rust.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy rust-resistant cultivars</li>
                <li>Check plants before bringing them home</li>
                <li>Quarantine New Plants</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to water plants to prevent rust fungus ?</h3>
           <p>Rust fungus must sit on a wet leaf for 6-10 hours before it can infect a plant. Do not use overhead watering to water a plant. Water using drip irrigation or other methods that do not wet the plant leaves, only the roots. Soil splashing up on leaves during watering is a major method of infection.
            Sometimes you can’t help but use a sprinkler system. If you must water overhead, do so from 5-10 A.M. so the leaves dry before nightfall.</p>
