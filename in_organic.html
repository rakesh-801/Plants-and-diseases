                <h4 style="display: inline-flex; margin: 0;padding: 0%;">Nitrogenous Fertilizers. The nitrogenous fertilizer industry includes the production of synthetic ammonia, nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, and urea.
                     Synthetic ammonia and nitric acid are used primarily as intermediates 
                     in the production of ammonium nitrate and urea fertilizers<h5>
                  <h3>What it does?</h3>
                  <p>Nitrogen is absorbed by the plant roots in two forms: nitrate form (NO3) and ammonical form (NH4). Most of the crop plants prefer nitrogen in nitrate form; but paddy and few other higher plants prefer nitrogen in ammonical form. Ammonical form of nitrogen is however, easily covertible into nitrate form. Most of the fertilizers 
                    contain nitrogen in these two available forms. Urea, however, contains 
                    nitrogen in amide form but this form of nitrogen is swiftly converted by soil micro-organisms into ammonical form and then into nitrate form. Based on the forms of nitrogen they contain, nitrogenous fertilizers are classified into following four categories, 
                    viz. (1) nitrate fertilizers, (2) ammonical fertilizers, (3) ammonical-nitrate fertilizers, and (4) amide fertilizers.</p>

                <h4 style="display: inline-flex; margin: 0;padding: 0%;">The most commonly used phosphatic fertilizers are Diammonium Phosphate (DAP), Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP), 
                    NPKs, and SSP. DAP is the world's most widely used phosphorus fertilizer. 
                    It is popular due to its relatively high nutrient content and its excellent physical properties.<h4>
                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <P>Phosphorus fertilizers are manufactured from rock phosphate (Figure 2.2), but rock phosphate itself seldom is used directly as a fertilizer because of its low availability of phosphorus and transport cost. Instead, finely ground rock phosphate is treated with sulfuric acid to yield monocalcium phosphate monohydrate and is known as superphosphate. About 85–90% 
                    of phosphate in superphosphate is water soluble. In another process, finely ground rock phosphate is reacted with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid (54% P2O5), also called green acid, and gypsum, which is removed as a by-product. Phosphoric 
                    acid usually is not used directly as a fertilizer because it is corrosive, but is used to manufacture other fertilizers. The reaction of phosphoric acid with finely ground rock phosphate yields triple superphosphate (TSP). MAP and DAP are the products of
                     reactions between phosphoric acid and ammonia. Phosphoric acid can be heated to drive off water to produce superphosphoric 
                    acid (68–70% P2O5), which when reacted with ammonia yields ammonium polyphosphate.
                    Phosphorus fertilization rates often are given in terms of P, not P2O5. The proportion of P in P2O5 is used to calculate the equivalent quantity of P in a fertilizer: 2 P/P2O5 = (2 × 31 g/mol)/142 g/mol = 0.437. Thus, the percentage of P in a 12-24-12 fertilizer is: 24% P2O5 × 0.437 = 10.5% P.</P>
                    <H2>Phosphorus cycle</H2>
                    <p>The use of phosphorus fertilizers and hence the rate of phosphorus accumulation in agricultural soils increased almost three-fold between 1960 and 1990. However, the rate of phosphorus accumulation has declined somewhat since 1990. The current flux of phosphorus to the oceans is now triple that of background rates, viz. 22 Tg P yr−1 versus 8 Tg P yr−1.

                        The use of nitrogen and phosphorus in the form of fertilizers are necessitated by cropping to fulfill in the food demand of a growing population. Fertilizer application should be site-specific as illustrated by the three maize-based cropping systems in Table 2.1. Only with this kind of approach optimum crop production with minimum environmental pollution is possible (Vitousek et al., 2009).</p>

                            <h5 style="padding: 15px 0px 15px 0px;">OVER VIEW ON COMPOUND FERTILIZERS</h5>
                            <P>Compound fertilizers are generally highly concentrated (containing boosted amounts of nutrients and little filler), so that they require less expenditure of labor 
                                and capital  than do simple fertilizers for application, storage, and hauling. Compound fertilizers have good physical properties; they do not cake and they scatter well when applied by machine. 
                                The nutrient ratios of compound fertilizers vary, depending 
                                on the method of production, the initial components, and the requirements of the plants fertilized.</P><br>
                            <p>Compound fertilizers have been used extensively since 1950, especially in the United States, Canada, England, the Netherlands, 
                                Japan, France, and Italy, where they constitute more than 50 percent of all fertilizer produced. In the USSR, plans for 1971–75 called for an increase
                                 in the share of highly concentrated and complex fertilizers to 80 percent of all fertilizer production.</p><br>
                            <p>Compound fertilizers are classified as either two-element (phosphorus-potassium, nitrogen-phosphorus, and nitrogen-potassium) 
                                or three-element (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium). Depending on the method of production, they are considered complex, complex-mixed, or mixed. Compound fertilizers are used for all crops, whereas 
                                complex fertilizers are used primarily for industrial crops, such as cotton and sugar beets.</p>

                            <p>Complex fertilizers are obtained through the chemical interaction of the initial components—ammonia, 
                                phosphoric acid, nitric acid, phosphorites, apatites, and natural potassium salts. They are produced in granulated form. The most common types 
                                of complex fertilizers in the USSR are Ammofos (nutrient content, 56–64 percent), Diammofos (71–74 percent), Nitrofos (38 percent), potassium nitrate (57 percent), Nitroammofoska (50–54 percent), and Nitrofoska (36 percent).
                                 The possibilities are promising for complex liquid fertilizers,
                                 potassium metaphosphate, and ammonium polyphosphate.</p>
