                      Second instar larvae enclose themselves in body leaf wrappings to make tubes and detach
                       themselves from the leaf and falls onto the water surface. They attach themselves to the tiller and bore into the stem.</p>

                <h2 style="display: inline-flex; margin: 0;padding: 0%;"><h2>What are Thrips ?</h2>
                <p>Thrips are tiny insects about as fat as a sewing needle that dine on many 
                  plants worldwide. Also known as thysanoptera or thunderflies, thrips are sucking 
                  insects that can cause some damage to plants. However, their damage can be much 
                  worse when they transmit viruses to plants.</p>
                  <h2>How to identify?</h2>
                  <p>Adult thrips are slender and tiny, at 1 / 50- to 1 / 25-inches long. Their colors can be anywhere from yellow to brown or black,
                     and if you try to get close to them, they will probably leap or fly away. They have narrow, fringed wings. The nymphs look like even smaller adults,
                      though they tend to be light green or yellow rather than darker colors. Their wings are also not fully developed, and they sometimes have red eyes.</p>
                  <h2>Thrips damage</h2>
                  <p>Thrips damage includes streaks, silvery speckling, and small white patches. This happens because the thrips suck plant cells from many garden plants, 
                    flowers, fruits, and shade trees. If you have a major infestation of thrips, your plants might be stunted with damaged flowers and fruit. The damage that
                     you notice might instead come from the virus that the thrips spread (usually tomato spotted wilt virus).</p>
                  <h2>How to get rid of it ?</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>To keep thrips populations under control, try using yellow or blue sticky traps.</li>
                    <li>Shaking branches to remove the thrips and catching them on a cloth underneath is one easy way to quickly remove the thrips from your plants.</li>
                    <li>For fruit trees: Spray dormant oil on the trees.</li>
                    <li>As a last resort, dust the undersides of leaves with diatomaceous earth.</li>

                  <li><strong>Citrus mealybugs</strong> attack citrus, landscape shrubs, and tropical or greenhouse specimens such as begonia, coleus, amaryllis, and cyclamen.</li>
                  <li><strong>Long-tailed mealybugs</strong> are named for the tail filaments that develop on this species. They prefer citrus, grapes, nursery stock, houseplants including dracaena, and can also affect a wide range of ornamental plants.</li>
                  <li><strong>Grape mealybugs</strong> target grape vines and fruit trees such as pears and pomegranates.</li>
                  <li><strong>Mexican mealybugs</strong> prefer to feed on ornamental plants including chrysanthemum, English ivy, lantana, geranium, hollyhock, and poinsettia.</li>
                  <li><strong>Root mealybugs</strong> feed on the roots of ornamentals including anemone, iris, yarrow, African violet, and many types of shrubs and ornamental grasses.</li>
                </ul>
              <h2>How to control melay bugs ?</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep plants healthy: </strong>
                  Healthy plants are more able to ward off pests and diseases.</li>
                  <li><strong>Plant selection:</strong>
                    Choose plants that are less prone to mealybugs.</li>
                  <li>Inspect new plants:
                    Carefully inspect newly purchased plants before bringing them home from the nursery to prevent spreading pests to other plants.</li>
                  <li>Know the signs:
                    Look for insects or eggs on new growth and more hidden areas. Check for plant damage, honeydew, or black sooty mold.</li>
                    
                    
                    <li>Apply horticultural oil regularly:
                    For susceptible plants, wipe down leaves periodically with Neem oil to discourage pests.</li>
                    
                    <li>Avoid nitrogen-rich fertilizer and overwatering:
                    Nitrogen stimulates tender new growth that mealybugs prefer, and may lead to increased egg production. Too much water can also lead to excessive new growth.</li>
                    
                    <li>Check tools, pots, and stakes:
                    Mealybugs and eggs sacs may be hidden in these spots.</li>
                    
                    <li>Lower indoor temperatures:
                    Mealybugs thrive in temperatures between 70 to 90 degrees F. For houseplants that can tolerate cooler temperatures, lower the thermostat to 60 degrees F at night to discourage pests.</li>

                <h2 style="display: inline-flex; margin: 0;padding: 0%;">Hypothenemus hampei, the coffee berry borer or coffee borer beetle, is a small beetle native to Africa. It is among the most
                   harmful pests to coffee crops across the world where coffee is cultivated. Spanish common names of the insect include barrenador del café, gorgojo del café, and broca del café</h2>
                   <h3>How to find berry borer ?</h3>
                   <p>The coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), called broca in Spanish, is a bark beetle endemic to Central Africa that is now distributed throughout all
                     coffee-producing countries in the world, with the exception of Nepal and Papua New Guinea. CBB (Fig. 1) is the most economically important coffee pest worldwide (Le Pelley 1968, Vega 2008).
                      Beetles of the subfamily Scolytinae are among the most damaging insects in the world: Their life cycle inside the host plant makes these insects difficult to control (Rudinsky 1962).</p>
                   <h2>Damage</h2>
                   <p>The coffee berry borer female (1.4-1.78 mm) attacks immature and mature coffee berries from about eight weeks after flowering up to harvest season (>32 weeks). 
                    Females bore a hole into the coffee berry (Fig. 3) and then construct galleries in the seeds (beans) where the eggs are deposited, followed by larval feeding on the coffee seed (Bustillo et al. 1998, Barrera 2008) (Fig. 4). Three types of damage have been reported: 
                    1) premature fall of young berries, 2) increased vulnerability of infested ripe berries to fungus or bacterial infection, and 3) reduction in both yield and quality of coffee, reducing the income of coffee growers (Damon 2000, Jaramillo et al. 2006). The coffee berry borer can
                     cause yield losses of 30-35% with 100% of berries infested at harvest time.
                     Damage may be greater if harvest is delayed (Barrera 2008).</p>
                  <h2>How to control the berry borer </h2>
                  <p>The recommendations below relate only to cultural control in the field and in wet and dry mills. The fungus Beauveria bassiana has also recently been approved for use in Hawaii as the products BotaniGard 
                    ES and Mycotrol O. Please refer to their product labels for application instructions. Additional information on the use of B. bassiana has also been made available by BioWorks Inc., and by the Kona Coffee Farmers Association. The insecticide Provado (imidacloprid) 
                    is used in coffee for control of green scale, but is not
                     recommended here, as it has not been evaluated nor labeled for use against coffee berry borer.</p>
