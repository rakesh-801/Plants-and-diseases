                <img class="common_image" style="height: 200px ;width: 200px;margin-right:50px;"src="compost_3.jpg" alt="">
                  <h3>Process of Compost </h3>
                  <p>The composting process happens due to the activity of micro-organisms (bacteria) and other larger
                    organisms like worms and insects. These need certain conditions to live. These include moisture and air.</p> 
                    <h3>Preparation of Compost</h3>
                    <p>Compost can be prepared in many ways by using raw materials like farm waste, kitchen waste, town refuse, cow dung, cow 
                        urine. All these raw materials undergo aerobic or anaerobic decomposition in certain periods resulting in a finished 
                        product that is completely organic and rich in nutrients. </p>
                    <h3>Factors of making a good compost</h3>
                    <li>Type of organic material, air, moisture, and temperature.</li>
                    <li>The acidity (pH) is also considered by some to be an important factor.</li> <br>
                    <h3>How long does it take for compost to be ready ?</h3>
                    <li>Compost can be made in as little as six to eight weeks, or, more usually, it can take a year or more.</li>
                    <li>In general, the more effort you put in, the quicker you will get compost.</li><br>
                    <h3>How to identify that the compost is ready ?</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The compost is ready for use when it's a rich brown colour.</li>
                    <li>The compost crumbles easily and also smells like earth.</li>
                    <li>Some signs that it may not be ready include: Recognizable food content still visible. The pile is still warm.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>How to manage ?</h3>
                    <p>Keep the compost pile moist, but not wet. The composting materials should feel damp like a wrung-out sponge. Turn the 
                        compost pile at least once or twice a month. Odors are emitted by poorly prepared or maintained compost piles.</p>
                    <h3>What are the benefits of Compost ?</h3>
                    <li>Improves the structure and health of your soil by adding organic matter.</li>
                    <li>Helps the soil retain moisture and nutrients.</li>
                    <li>Reduces the potential for soil erosion.</li>

                <h5>Manure is a valuable soil amendment for home gardens. Animal manure is a valuable soil amendment for home gardens. It not 
                    only supplies primary nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) and micronutrients for plant growth, but also is a 
                    source of organic matter.<h5>
                  <h3>Preparation of Manure </h3>
                  <li>Manure is obtained from the decomposition of plant or animal wastes.</li>
                  <li>Plant and animal wastes are dumped in pits at open places and allow it to decompose by microbes.</li>
                  <li>The decomposition product is manure.</li><br>
                  <h3>Types of Manure</h3>
                  <p>There are 2 types of manures :
                    <li>Green Manure</li>
                    <li>Organic Manure</li>
                  </p>
                  <h3>What is the best way to apply manure ?</h3>
                  <p>The best way to use manure as plant fertilizer is by mixing it in with compost. Composting manure eliminates the possibility 
                    of burning the plants.</p>
                    <h3>What are the factors of Manure ?</h3>
                    <li>The primary factors that affect nutrient composition of manure are livestock type, stage of growth and feeding practices 
                        (all of which determine nutrient excretion rates).</li>
                    <li>he amount of bedding or water added to the manure, type of manure storage, time that the manure spends in storage and 
                        weather conditions.</li> <br>
                    <h3>How long does it take before it can be used as a manure?</h3>
                    <li>Manure needs about 3â€“4 months to mature before it can be used as fertilizer, if conditions are ideal.</li>
                    <li>It can take a year or more if the starting material contains a wide carbon:nitrogen ratio (as is the case when manure 
                        contains wood chips).</li><br>
                    <h3>How to manage ?</h3>
                    <p>The most known technology for manure management is the anaerobic digestion, which is a process in which organic matter 
                        from wet organic wastes (ie. liquid manure, food processing wastes, etc.) is converted into methane by bacteria in the 
                        absence of oxygen.</p>

                <h5>Bone Meal fertiliser is made by coarsely crushing animal bones and other waste from the slaughterhouse. It is an excellent source of 
                    phosphorus, nitrogen, and calcium in the plant. This fertiliser is made by coarsely crushing animal bones and other waste 
                    from the slaughterhouse.<h5><br>
                    <h3>How to apply bone meal fertiliser ?</h3>
                    <li>During soil preparation:  Sprinkle bone meal fertiliser evenly over the soil or add to planting compost. 
                            Make sure it's mixed well. If the weather is dry, water in well.</li>
                    <li>In the growing season:  If you're adding bone meal throughout the growing season, sprinkle evenly around established part 
                             of the soil and gently fork it into the surface. Be careful not to disturb plant roots as you do so. Water thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>Plants in containers: For established plants in containers, apply the bone meal fertiliser at the start of the season and 
                            then once or twice throughout the growing season to help strengthen plants. Again, sprinkle around the plants and work it 
                            into the soil being careful of any roots, then water well.</li>
                    <li>Vegetable plots: If you're using a bone meal for your vegetable plot, add fertiliser and fork it into the soil before 
                            planting any seeds.</li>
                    <li>New plants: Once you've made a planting hole fork a small amount of bone meal for plants into the hole. You can also add 
                            it to the compost and soil that will be used as the planting mixture. Water thoroughly.</li><br>
                  <h3>What plants is bone meal best for?</h3>
                  <p>Bone meal fertilizer is an ideal soil additive for growing carrots, beets, potatoes, and other root crops. That's because of 
                    its high level of phosphorus, which aids in healthy root formation. Bone meal fertilizer can also help establish perennials 
                    during their first year.</p>
                    <h3>How long does it take for bone meal to break down in soil?</h3>
                    <p>Bone meal fertilizer takes about four months to fully break down in the soil, so don't reapply within this time period. 
                        Bone meal fertilizer makes a wonderful organic fertilizer to supply your plants with important nutrients like calcium 
                        and phosphorus, promoting strong, healthy plants and produce.</p>
                    <h3>What are the disadvantages of Bone Meal ?</h3>
                    <li>Bone meal can be harmful when inhaled.</li>
                    <li>Bone meal is ineffective in alkaline soils.</li>

                    essentially earthworm waste, otherwise known as worm poo. As these creatures eat through compost, their waste creates an 
                    optimal soil enricher.</h5>
                    <h3>How many types of vermi are there ?</h3>
                    <p>Most worm farms raise two main types of earthworm:

                        <li>Lumbricus rubellis</li>
                    </p>
                  <h3>Making of Worm Castings</h3>
                  <p>When making a worm castings bin, layer the bottom with sand and strips of moist newspaper. Then, add compost, manure, or 
                    leaf litter and another layer of moist newspaper strips and soil. Add some worms and food, such as kitchen scraps or garden 
                    waste.</p>
                <h3>How long does it take to make worm castings ?</h3>
                <p>Harvesting Castings from your Worm Bin</p>
                <p>After about three to six months of being fed, compost worms will have created enough compost to harvest. In this two bin 
                    system, when your bin is getting full you are ready to add the next layer of bin, nesting it on top.</p>
                <h3>How do you control worm casts ?</h3>
                <p>Earthworms are much less abundant in acidic soils, so in theory reducing the soil pH (acidification) should help to reduce a 
                    worm cast problem. Reducing food sources such as clippings and fallen leaves and top dressing with sand have also been 
                    suggested as methods of reducing earthworm numbers.</p>
                <h3>What are the benefits of worm castings ?</h3>
                <li>Adds organic matter to the soil.</li>
